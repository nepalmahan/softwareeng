I've used Test-Driven Development (TDD) and automated testing to create it.

Here's how the process is done:

Test-Driven Development (TDD):
------------------------------
 I followed a method called Test-Driven Development (TDD). It's like building a puzzle by fitting pieces together. Here's the process of doing it.

1. **Write a Test**: Before even writing the code, I wrote tests that described how I wanted parts
   of the game to work. These tests were like my expectations for how the game should behave.

2.  I started with a tiny piece of code to make the first test pass. This helped me create a foundation for my game.

3.: As I added more code to make more tests pass, I kept improving and refining the game. This way, I built the game piece by piece while knowing everything was working as planned.

Automated Unit Testing:
-----------------------
 I used a tool called 'pytest' for automated testing. These tests are like little checklists that the computer follows to make sure my game does what I expect.

For example, I wrote tests to see if the game correctly handles when someone guesses the number right,
wrong, or even when they want to quit the game.

Putting It All Together:
-------------------------
By using TDD and automated tests, my 'Guess the Number' game is reliable.
When we play it, or anyone else does, they're experiencing a well-tested and well-crafted game.

To play the game, just run the 'guess_the_number_game.py' file. The game will guide you through guessing
the number and give you hints along the way.

For testing, run the 'test_guess_the_number_game.py' file with 'pytest'. This will run the automated
tests and make sure everything is working as intended.
